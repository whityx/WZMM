"""Record mode: assign which meshes are visible at each cycle position of a
`[Key...]` toggle, and rewrite the ini's `if`/`elif`/`endif` gates to match.

A cycle toggle steps through positions 0..N-1; at each position every var the
section cycles uses its value at that row. If its list is shorter than the
section's longest list, 3Dmigoto keeps its final value for the remaining rows.
The caller (the frontend, which already has the mesh payload's `conditions`)
decides both the explicit set of drawindexed *sources* owned by the recording
and, per position, which of those sources should be visible. Each source
carries its originating ini, original line number, and stable
section/occurrence/drawindexed identity; this module resolves that identity
against the authoritative staged document.

This is deliberately conservative: only a well-defined "safe pattern" is
rewritten automatically; everything else is refused and reported rather than
guessed at. A chain is safe to regenerate only if:

    - it has no `else` branch (ambiguous to invert without full DNF work);
    - every branch's condition reads exactly `{var}` and nothing else;
    - no branch contains a nested `if` of its own;
    - every non-blank/comment line in every branch is a `drawindexed` line
      with recorded data for it;
    - `IniDocument.is_safe_to_rewrite` agrees the section's nesting isn't
      already ambiguous.

A safe chain is regenerated wholesale (its whole `if`..`endif` span replaced
in one splice) rather than edited branch-by-branch, since `elif` branches
are mutually exclusive and evaluated in order -- surgically OR-ing a value
into one branch can silently do nothing if an earlier sibling already
claims it.

A drawindexed line whose entire ancestor chain never references this var at
all gets a brand-new private `if <expr> ... endif` nested directly around
just that line -- this is what lets a previously-unrelated or freshly-added
mesh become gated by a toggle for the first time. If the var is referenced
only through some outer (non-immediate) ancestor, this module declines to
guess and reports it instead.
